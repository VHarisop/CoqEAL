CoqEAL - The Coq Effective Algebra Library
==========================================

This repository contains a subset of the work that was developed in
the context of the ForMath european project (2009-2013).
This archive is split in four parts:

- theory (package  CoqEAL_theory), which contains  formal developments
  in algebra.

- refinements (package  CoqEAL_refinements), which  contains optimized
  algorithms with a framework to  ease change of representation during
  a proof.

- v0.1, a previous version of the framework, for archiving purpose.

- doc, tools for generating documentation out of local documentation.


### Installation

Running `./configure.sh` should install everything you need automatically,
provided that your Coq installation has been configured properly.
