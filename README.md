CoqEAL - The Coq Effective Algebra Library
==========================================

This repository contains a subset of the work that was developed in
the context of the ForMath european project (2009-2013).
This archive is split in four parts:

- theory (package  CoqEAL_theory), which contains  formal developments
  in algebra.

- refinements (package  CoqEAL_refinements), which  contains optimized
  algorithms with a framework to  ease change of representation during
  a proof.

- v0.1, a previous version of the framework, for archiving purpose.

- doc, tools for generating documentation out of local documentation.


### Installation

On a Linux machine, running `./configure.sh` should install everything you
need automatically provided that your Coq installation has been configured
properly. Make sure you have installed `MathComp`, version >= 1.6, prior to
running the script.
